# The mission :

* Create a repository called restaurant-css-framework in which you must realise a window web page for a restaurant. The franchise is fictive, but the type of food (burger, pizza, asian, …​) is your choice.

* The website must be responsive, at least for small and medium screens. It must at least have five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and contact.

* Welcome  
A page with one Jumbotron and two panels to show news (promo, events, etc…​).

* Menu  
A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.

* Pictures  
A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page).

* Restaurant  
A page about the restaurants (it’s a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and different schedules.

* Contact  
A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically correct tag.
